# Inference in Regression



## Recall Our Model and Fitted Values

- Consider the model
$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i
$$
- $\epsilon \sim N\left(0,\sigma^2\right)$
- We assume that the true model is known
- We assume that you've seen confidence intervals and hypothesis tests before
- $\hat\beta_0 = \bar Y - \hat\beta_1 \bar X$
- $\hat\beta_1 = Cor\left(Y,X\right) \frac{Sd\left(Y\right)}{Sd\left(X\right)}$
