## Question 1

Load the dataset `Seatbelts` as part of the `datasets` package via `data(Seatbelts)`. Use `as.data.frame` to convert the object to a dataframe. Create a new outcome variable for whether or not greater than 119 drivers were killed that month. Fit a logistic regression GLM with this variable as the outcome and `kms`, `PetrolPrice`, and `law` as predictors. Interpret your parameters.

```{r, Q1Ans}
require(datasets)
require(dplyr)
data(Seatbelts)
sb <- as.data.frame(Seatbelts)
sb <- mutate(sb,
             pp = (PetrolPrice - mean(PetrolPrice)) / sd(PetrolPrice),
             mm = kms / 1000,
             mmc = mm - mean(mm),
             dk119 = 1 * (DriversKilled > 119))
fit <- glm(dk119 ~ pp + mmc + law, binomial, sb)
1 - exp(summary(fit)$coef[,1])
exp(confint(fit))
anova(fit)
```

**ANSWER:** We saw a 45% decrease in the odds that > 119 drivers were killed once the law was enacted, holding gas prices & distance traveled constant.

## Question 2

Fit a binomial model with `DriversKilled` as the outcome and `drivers` as the total count with `kms`, `PetrolPrice`, and `law` as predictors, interpret your results.

```{r, Q2Ans}
fit <- glm(cbind(DriversKilled, drivers - DriversKilled) ~ pp + mmc + law, binomial, sb)
summary(fit)$coef
anova(fit)
1 - exp(summary(fit)$coef[,1])
exp(confint(fit))
```

**ANSWER:** This model suggests a 3 % increase in the % of drivers killed once the law was enacted, holding gas price & distance driven fixed.

---

## Question 3

Refer to question 1. Use the `anova` function to compare models with just `law`, `law` and `PetrolPrice`, and all three predictors.

```{r, Q3Ans}
fit <- glm(dk119 ~ law + pp + mmc, binomial, sb)
anova(fit, "chisq")
```
